If you do not have the login credentials for posgres, follow the steps to recover password.

1. Edit pg_hba.conf to allow you to connect without a password. 
location: C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.5\data\pg_hba.conf

host    all             all             ::1/128                 trust
instead of :
host    all             all             ::1/128                 md5

2. Then use ALTER USER to reset the password. 
ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD '<supperscret>';


3. Then change pg_hba.conf back again.
host    all             all             ::1/128                 md5
